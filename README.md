# Pyhaproxy
It's a Python library to parse haproxy config file. Thanks to [canopy](https://github.com/jcoglan/canopy), which I use for auto-generating Python codes by PEG grammar. But the 'Extension methods for node' feature in canopy seems broken, I always encounter the MRO errors when running `parse` function. So I modify the generated codes which mainly rename the `TreeNode*` to specified treenode name, eg: GlobalSection, GlobalHeader, BackendHeader, and so on.

# Install
This project has no other Python libraries dependency. Just clone the code.

# Run
To be implemented.
